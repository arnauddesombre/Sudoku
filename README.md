# Sudoku

This is an Sudoku solver spreadsheet; the embedded macro solves any Sudoku puzzle.<br>

Solving strategies implemented in the spreadsheet are:<br>
[X]   Basic Solving<br>
[X]   Naked Pairs<br>
[X]   Box-Line Pointing<br>
[X]   Y - Wing<br>
[X]   X - Wing<br>
[X]   Hidden Pairs<br>
[X]   Naked Triples<br>
[X]   Naked Quads<br>
[X]   Hidden Triples<br>
[X]   Hidden Quads<br>
[X]   Swordfish<br>
[X]   Simple Color<br>

The display uses various colors so that every algorithm is self explanatory and can be clearly understood. The macro contains useful links to the necessary algorithms and background information.<br>

The algorithm is not particularly optimized and basically rotates through all the strategies acceptable for the user (strategies can be selected or deselected) until a solution is found.
